                <p>Sometimes, right in the middle of an ordinary life, love gives you a fairytale. Weddings By Sonali (WBS) will do all that we can to help you write the most beautiful beginning to your very own ‘happily ever after’.
                    Love is never ordinary. And rarely is it ever perfect. But it doesn’t' have to be. It just needs to be perfect for you. Our goal is to make your wedding the very best reflection of yourself and your love. We will work with you from concept and design to roll out and execution, to give life to an event that is beautiful, soulful and uniquely you.
                    An unforgettable wedding is not one big thing, it is a million little things. We believe in the little things because the little things have the biggest meaning. From the perfect location to the tiniest place setting, from the grandest vision to the tiniest quirk, we aspire to create an event that celebrates your past and your future, giving life to memories that you can grow old with.  </p>
